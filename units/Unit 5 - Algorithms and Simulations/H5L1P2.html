        <h3>Searching in Unsorted Data</h3>
        <p>When searching for an item in <em>unsorted</em> data, you have to check every item until you find the value
            you are looking for.</p>

                    Build a <code>position of number in unsorted list</code> block that reports the earliest location of
                    a number in an unsorted list or reports "Not In List" (or NIL, if you like) if the number is not in
                    the list.<br />

        </div>
        <div class="endnote">Searching unsorted data can become slow if we're dealing with a lot of data, but it is
            quick
            when working with short lists.</div>


        <h3>Searching in Sorted Data</h3>
        <p>If you are searching for a number in a <em>sorted</em> list, you have more information. Suppose you have a
            sorted
            list and you want to locate the position of a number.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Typically, sorted lists are from lowest to highest. You'll create a block that sorts a list
            of
            numbers in Unit 8, <a

        <div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>Alphie: </span> If the list is sorted, we could look at the middle element of the list and see if
                our
                number is in the first or last half of the list. That would save time.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> This feels a lot like the guessing game we built&mdash;I pick a number and the
                computer tries to guess it by splitting the list in half with each guess.</div>
            <div class="comment">Brian wants us to scrub the list name "awful list" from the curriculum, and Mary
                agrees.

            <div>
                <span>Alphie: </span> But in that one, the computer guessed a number that we picked. Now we want it to
                find
                a number in a list and report its position. It should work like this:<br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/position-of-number-11-in-sorted-list-awful-list.png"
                    alt="position of number (11) in sorted list (awful list) reporting 5"
                    title="position of number (11) in sorted list (awful list) reporting 5" />
            </div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> Yes, but it still <em>feels</em> the same. It should have the same guts as the
                guessing game.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="takeNote">Betsy's last remark is a version of <strong>abstraction</strong>. Betsy noticed that
            <code>position in sorted list</code> and the <a

            <em>structure</em>.

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="2">
                <li>Using the strategy of your guessing game project from the previous page, write a block that says:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the <em>position</em> of an item in an ordered list, and,</li>
                        <li>the <em>number of guesses</em> it takes to find the number</li>

                    Then, build a <code>position of number in sorted list</code> block that returns the
                    position of a number in a list sorted from lowest to highest or zero if the number is not in the
                    list.
                    (Note: This task is identical to the previous one except that instead of the block "saying" the
                    position
                    it will need to "report" the position.)<br />
