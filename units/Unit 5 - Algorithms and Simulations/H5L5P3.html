        <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn how military technologies end up being used for civilian
            purposes and consider the ethics of working on military technologies.</p>

        <ol>
            <li> Look up the following: <ol>
                    <li>Which came first, nuclear power plants or nuclear weapons?</li>
                    <li>Who set up the GPS satellite network, and why?</li>
                    <li>Who paid for the development of the Internet, and why?</li>

    <p>Many technologies are developed for military purposes and turn out also to be useful for the rest of us.</p>

        <ol start="2">
            <li>Brainstorm as big a list as you can of <strong>dual-use technologies</strong>. (It doesn't count as
                dual-use if a technology developed for everyone to use, such as the telephone, is useful to the military
                in the same way that it's useful to anyone.)</li>

        <p><strong>1.1 Contribute to society and human well-being.</strong></p>
        <p>This principle concerning the quality of life of all people affirms an obligation to protect fundamental
            human rights and to respect the diversity of all cultures. An essential aim of computing professionals is to
            minimize negative consequences of computing systems, including threats to health and safety. When designing
            or implementing systems, computing professionals must attempt to ensure that the products of their efforts
            will be used in socially responsible ways, will meet social needs, and will avoid harmful effects to health
            and welfare...</p>
        <p><strong>1.2 Avoid harm to others.</strong></p>
        <p>"Harm" means injury or negative consequences, such as undesirable loss of information, loss of property,
            property damage, or unwanted environmental impacts. This principle prohibits use of computing technology in
            ways that result in harm to any of the following: users, the general public, employees, employers. Harmful
            actions include intentional destruction or modification of files and programs leading to serious loss of
            resources or unnecessary expenditure of human resources such as the time and effort required to purge
            systems of "computer viruses." ...</p>

                these does the ACM consider more harmful?</li>
            <li>Research and discuss: Is it ethical to work on weapons? How do some ACM members justify such work? Does
                it matter if the work is on a dual-use technology?</li>
