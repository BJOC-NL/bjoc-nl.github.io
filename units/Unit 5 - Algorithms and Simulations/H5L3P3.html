                <p>It's rare to find polynomial time algorithms that take more than cubic (<em>n</em><sup>3</sup>) time.

                    <p><a href="#hint-between-categories" data-toggle="collapse">What if algorithm takes an amount of
                            time that's <em>between</em> two categories?</a></p>
                    <div id="hint-between-categories" class="collapse">These categories say that an algorithm takes
                        <em>at most</em> so much time. So, for example, a constant-time algorithm is also a linear-time
                        algorithm, and also a polynomial-time algorithm . But <em>usually</em> if someone says an
                        algorithm "takes quadratic time," they mean that it takes <em>more than</em> linear time but
                        <em>not more than</em> quadratic time.</div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Unreasonable Time:</strong> If the number of steps is more than any power of the size of the
                input (that is, more than any polynomial function ), then the algorithm takes an <em>unreasonable</em>
                amount of time. <div class="endnote">The classic example of an <em>unreasonable time</em> algorithm is
                    one that takes <em>exponential</em> (2<sup><em>n</em></sup>) <em>time</em>. Just <em>adding 1</em>
                    to the input size (<em>n</em>) <em>doubles</em> the number of steps! </div>
                <p>One kind of problem whose solution often ends up unreasonable is an <em>optimization</em> problem
                    (such as "find the best" or "find the smallest"). </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <div class="takeNote">It's important to recognize that an unreasonable-time algorithm <strong>still solves a problem
            correctly</strong>. Unreasonable-time algorithms can sometimes be replaced by <em>heuristics</em>, which are
        polynomial-time algorithms that don't solve the problem exactly, but give a good enough approximation.</div>
    <p>One reason it's worth learning these categories is that in writing programs, you often need to solve a problem
        for which there are already established solutions. For example, you've learned that searching for something in
        an unordered list takes linear time, but if the list is sorted, you can search it faster (in sublinear time). So
        when you're writing a program that needs to search through a list repeatedly, you'll know that it's worthwhile
        to sort the list before the searching. Knowing about standard algorithms that already exist can help you
        construct new algorithms.</p>
