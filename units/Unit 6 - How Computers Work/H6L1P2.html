        <h2>Het Softwaredomein: Applicaties</h2>
        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll explore some of the many purposes for which people use
            software applications.</div>
        <p> Application programs (or "apps" for short) are the programs that users interact with. Here are some uses of
            such software that you may be familiar with: <ul>
                <li><strong>Communication.</strong> You use a browser to view web pages on the World Wide Web. You keep
                    in touch with friends using social networking, email, text messages, and chat applications that can
                    be text-based, audio-based, or video-based. You can also tell the world what you think in a blog
                    (short for weblog) or a vlog (short for video blog).</li>
                <li><strong>Audio.</strong> Your computer or phone almost certainly has an application to play
                    music&mdash;either from your own collection or from an Internet radio server. You can also use
                    software to <em>create</em> music by using synthesizers that make new sounds, sampling (reusing)
                    existing sounds, and recording sounds around you. For example, instead of being limited to someone
                    else's music selections on the radio, apps like Pandora create an individualized radio station just
                    for you.</li>
                <li><strong>Pictures.</strong> You likely have a photo viewing application on your own computer or
                    phone. You can also use software to manipulate pictures to create artwork, sharpen the focus, or
                    create "fake news" by combining unrelated images. For example, when you get x-rays, the results are
                    emailed to the doctor right away instead of having to wait for the images to be developed.</li>
                <li><strong>Video.</strong> You can use streaming video services to watch movies online, or you can
                    create your own. You can shoot movies on your phone, edit them by combining video from different
                    sources, and upload them to the Internet or burn them onto a DVD to share them with your friends.
                    Professional movie-making uses computer animation to create special effects like space aliens,
                    armies of soldiers, and super heroes jumping over buildings.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Your</em> programs.</strong> The projects you've been creating in Snap<em>!</em> are
                    apps too!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p> There are other kinds of software that aren't for personal use but are used in industry and universities.
            Software applications are written to guide rockets, to analyze the results of experiments, and to design
            buildings and cars. Software is even written to write software. <ul>
                <li>The amount of information available on the Internet is huge. Computers can learn to combine
                    information from different sources, to produce surprising results. This is called <strong>data
                        mining</strong>. For example, businesses can combine location information from your phone with
                    similar information from other phones to find traffic jams or popular restaurants. Or they can
                    combine multiple sources of online information about you to send you targeted advertising for
                    products you're likely to want or to keep track of your political views for voter registration
                    drives.</li>
                <li>Computers can be taught to <em>generalize</em> from the information they finds to patterns to
                    predict the future. This is called <strong>machine learning</strong>. For example, scientists teach
                    computers to explore telescope observations to learn new things about how the physical universe
                    works.</li>
                <li>You can use <strong>spreadsheets</strong> to manage your budget or to make charts and tables.
                    Spreadsheets are a computer implementation of what was previously a pencil-and-paper process; they
                    are the application that made businesses take personal computers seriously.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>As new kinds of hardware are invented, new kinds of software become important. For example, the invention of
            the smartphone, which is always with its owner, has enabled applications such as song identification: you
            hear a song you like that you haven't heard before so you hold your phone up, and it samples the sound and
            finds it in a song database. Because our phones are almost always on, they can collect information about
            where you are. This can be desirable when you look for friends who have agreed to share location information
            with you, but it also may allow your employer to find out that you took part in a political demonstration
            for or against civil rights. </p>
