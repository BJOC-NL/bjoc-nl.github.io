        <h2>Binary Sequences</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>Op deze pagina,</strong> you will learn more about how information is represented inside the
                computer as sequences of bits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sidenote">In many programming languages there's a convention that every text string ends with a
            <em>null</em> byte, in which all eight bits are zero, a code that's reserved for this purpose. So our
            "<code>Welcome...</code>" string might actually occupy 44 bytes.</div>
        <p>So far we've been working with small chunks of data, from Boolean values (one bit) to characters (eight
            bits). But of course some information in your computer or smartphone is much bigger than that. For starters,
            characters aren't generally used one at a time; they're used in <em>text strings</em> such as "<code>Welcome
                to the Beauty and Joy of Computing.</code>" These 43 characters occupy 43 bytes of computer memory. But
            the real champion users of space are media files: pictures, sounds (mostly music), and video.</p>
        <p>If we could see inside the memory's bits, a section of the memory might look something like this:</p>
        <div class="blockquote"> <code class="break">
                01000001001000000111001101101101011000010111001001110100001000000111000001101000011011110110111001100101001011000010000001101100011010010110101101100101001000000111100101101111011101010111001000100000011011000110000101110000011101000110111101110000001000000110111101110010001000000110010001100101011100110110101101110100011011110111000000100000011000110110111101101101011100000111010101110100011001010111001000101100001000000110001101100001011011100

            <p>A <strong>binary sequence</strong> (also called a <em>bitstream</em>) is a string of ones and zeros. </p>
        </div>
        <p>That shows just 449 bits. A 16GB cell phone has sixteen gigabytes (about 16 billion bytes) of storage, each
            byte containing 8 bits. That's 128,000,000,000 bits. Printed on paper as ones and zeros, the 16 GB phone's
            memory would take nearly 40,000,000 pages! The information in storage—whether it is a text message, a
            photograph, a song, a computer program, or a list of phone numbers—looks just the same, a sequence of bits
            that are either On or Off (one or zero).</p>

            <p>So if pictures, music, and words all look the same in memory—all binary sequences—how can the computer
                tell what any chunk of memory actually is? For example, should the sequence 01000001 be interpreted as
                the number 65, the letter A, a rather dark shade of red, or something else?</p>
            <p>The meaning of a sequence of bits depends on the context in which it is used. What exactly do we mean by
                "context"? How does a programming language know whether to interpret a bit sequence as an integer, a
                picture, a string of characters, an instruction, or something else? There's always <em>another</em> bit
                sequence somewhere that encodes the <strong>data type</strong> of the bit sequence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote"> <a href="#hint-data-types" data-toggle="collapse">But different languages use data types
                differently.</a>
            <div id="hint-data-types" class="collapse">
                <p> In high-level languages, that data type code is attached to the value itself. In lower-level
                    languages, when you make a variable, you have to say what type of value it will contain, and the
                    data type is attached to the <em>variable</em>, so you can't get exact answers when the values are
                    integers and also be able to handle non-integer values of the same variable. So instead of seeing:
                    <br /> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/varfoo.png" alt="Geen Afbeelding" /><br /> you
                    see things like:<br /> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/intfoo.png"
                        alt="Geen Afbeelding" /> </p>
                <p>Snap<em>!</em> has strengths that many programming languages do not, and it's very likely that your
                    <em>next</em> year's computer science class will use one of those other languages. For example, if
                    you take the AP Computer Science A course, you will use Java.</p>
