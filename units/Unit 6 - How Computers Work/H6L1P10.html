            <p>The <strong>transistor</strong> is the fundamental building block of electronic circuits, where they are
                used as on/off switches.</p> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/transistors.jpg"

        <p>You've learned that a wire can either have a voltage or not have a voltage on it. The reality is more
            complicated. The on-or-off picture of a wire, a transistor, or a logic gate output is a
            simplification&mdash;an abstraction. </p> <img class="imageLeft" height="220"

        <p>This is a rough graph of the actual input-output behavior of a transistor. Don't worry about the details;
            just notice the two blue <em>flat</em> parts of the graph. Within the "cutoff" region, small changes to the
            input voltage do not change the output voltage at all; the output is always <em>zero</em> volts. Likewise
            within the "saturation" region, small input changes hardly impact output voltage; the output is interpreted
            as a <em>one</em>. This is how transistors are used as <em>switches</em> in a computer.</p>
        <p>Transistors are versatile devices. When used in the middle, linear (pink) part of the graph, they're
            <em>amplifiers</em>; a small variation in input voltage produces a large variation in output voltage. That's
            how they're used to play music in a stereo. </p>
        <div class="endnote" style="overflow: hidden;"> <a href="#hint-chart-labels" data-toggle="collapse">Why are they
                called "cutoff," "linear," and "saturation"?</a>
            <div id="hint-chart-labels" class="collapse">The lower region of the curve is called "cutoff" because the
                transistor's output is <em>cut off</em> (the output is zero) for any input in that region. The upper
                region is called "saturation" because, like a sponge that can't get any wetter, the transistor can't
                give more output no matter how big the input. The central region is called "linear" because it behaves
                like a linear (straight) function.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote">The transistor was invented in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley
            at Bell Laboratories, also the home of Unix. The inventors were awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for
            this work.</div>
        <div class="takeNote">The digital domain is not a law of nature; circuit designers have to work at ensuring that
            each wire in a circuit is always either fully on or fully off. The digital domain is an abstraction.</div>
        <div class="endnote"> <a href="#hint-digital-abstraction" data-toggle="collapse">Learn more about what's below
                the digital abstraction and how it's applied.</a>
            <div id="hint-digital-abstraction" class="collapse">
                <p>The flatness of the output at the two extremes is important because there <em>will</em> be small
                    changes in the input. Electrical circuits have "noise," undesired changes in voltages, for reasons
                    from the transistors getting hot to loose connections on the circuit board to cosmic rays. This is
                    why computers use zeros and ones: a transistor has two flat regions in its input-output curve.</p>
                <p>But the flatness of the saturated region is only approximate, and it depends on how the transistor is
                    connected to the rest of the circuit. One example of a potential problem is <em>fanout,</em> the
                    number of transistor inputs to which one transistor's output is connected. Beyond a certain number
                    (it depends on the particular transistor type, but certainly ten inputs would be too many), the
                    output voltage is reduced to the point that those inputs might not be sure whether they're getting a
                    zero or a one. </p>
                <p>The way a transistor really works depends on quantum physics. (We're not talking about <em>quantum
                        computers;</em> plain old computer circuits are based on quantum effects also.) To learn more
                    about analog-domain circuit design and what's inside a transistor, take an Electrical Engineering
                    course. </p>
