         <h2>Partition Sort</h2>
         <p> Another commonly used sort is called a <strong>partition sort</strong>. Here's how it works: <ul>
                 <li><strong>Step 1.</strong> In an unsorted list, select the first item in the list (<em>which probably
                         won't be the item that should appear first after sorting</em>). This item is called a
                     <strong>pivot</strong>.</li>
                 <div class="todo">BH: About step 2 and its yellow box: This handwaves away the deep issue, which is
                     that sometimes the sort key is smaller than the sort record, so two records may sort alike but not
                     be equal. I'm not sure if this has to be addressed but maybe it should be mentioned in the TG. BK:
                     I didn't understand what this comment means, sorry.</div>
                 <li>
                     <div class="sidenote">An item is "with the pivot" only if it has the same value as the pivot.</div>
                     <strong>Step 2.</strong> For each item in the list, decide if it comes before the pivot, with the
                     pivot, or after the pivot.
                 </li>
                 <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Partition the data into three categories: items before the pivot, with the
                     pivot, after the pivot. The lists before and after the pivot are unsorted.</li>
                 <li><strong>Step 4.</strong> If there are items before the pivot, use a partition sort to put them in
                     order. If there are items after the pivot, use a partition sort to put them in order.</li>
                 <li><strong>Step 5.</strong>The sorted list is made from appending the three result lists together.
                 </li>
             </ul>
         </p>
         <div class="takeNote">Names aren't sorted while placing them before or after a pivot. For <img

                  />, this is the status after the
             first split via pivoting: the <strong>pivot</strong> is Emma, the list before the pivot is <var>{Ava,
                 Abigail}</var>, and the list after the pivot is <var>{Olivia, Sophia, Isabella, Mia, Emily}</var>. The
             sorting process then continues on these two smaller unsorted lists.</div>

         <p>To write a <code>partition sort</code> block in Snap<em>!</em>, you'll need code for a base case, and code

                 <!--<p>In that script we've renamed <code>sort</code> to <code>merge&nbsp;sort</code>, and used the name <code>your&nbsp;sort</code> for the one you wrote earlier.  <code>Biglist</code>, <code>your-time</code>, and <code>merge-time</code> are global variables.</p> <p>Most likely, mergesort will take less than four seconds, while the one you wrote earlier will take more than 15 seconds. That's because we're betting your earlier one positions one number at a time in the sorted list, whereas mergesort cuts the list into two half-size lists and sorts them separately, which is inherently more efficient. If you make the input list ten times as long, a one-at-a-time sort will take 100 times as long to compute the result, whereas mergesort will only take about 30 times as long.</p> -->
