            <p><strong>Op deze pagina,</strong> you will learn the system for ensuring that communication is
                <em>reliable</em> on the Internet.</p>
        </div>


        <p>Computers, servers, and routers are fairly reliable, but every once in a while a packet will be lost, and
            devices on the Internet need to tolerate these faults. One way to tolerate faults is not to care. (If you
            lose one frame of video, it doesn't matter.) Another way (called TCP) is to keep sending packets until they
            are acknowledged as having been received correctly. <strong>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</strong>
            guarantees <em>reliable</em> data transmission by keeping track of which packets have been received
            successfully, resending any that have been lost or damaged, and specifying the order for reassembling the
            data on the other end. </p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
            <p><strong>TCP/IP</strong> is a pair of protocols that provide an abstraction. <strong>IP</strong> lets your
                computer pretend it has a <em>direct</em> connection to another computer. <strong>TCP</strong> lets your
                computer pretend it has a <em>reliable</em> connection to the other computer.</p>

                The TCP/IP end-to-end design of the Internet is an abstraction:
                <ul>
                    <li>The computers (including servers) at the two endpoints of a communication run the
                        <strong>Transmission Control Protocol</strong> (TCP), which guarantees reliable transmission.
                    </li>
                    <li>The routers at every connection point on the Internet run the <strong>Internet Protocol</strong>
                        (IP), which transmits packets from one IP address to another.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The routers don't know anything about the messages they carry; all they care about is transmitting them.
                The computers that send and receive the messages are the only ones concerned with what the messages

        <p>TCP works by including additional information along with each packet so that the receiving computer can keep
            track of how many packets it has received, re-request any missing packets, and reorder the packets to
            reconstruct the original message. In this simulation, a packet either arrives correctly (even if it's out of
            order) or it doesn't arrive at all. But on the Internet, it's possible for a packet to arrive with
            <em>erroneous</em> data, so the real TCP has to check for errors and request re-transmission of packets with
            errors too.</p>

                        That block simulates the unreliable network. You could "solve" the problem by rewriting this
                        block to simulate a perfect network instead of an imperfect one, but that misses the point.
                    </div>
                    To solve this problem, you'll need a way to keep track of the order of the data <em>and</em> a way
                    to re-request missing packets:
                    <ul>
                        <li>First, solve the problem of packets arriving out of order. You can include extra
                            <strong>header</strong> information in addition to the packet data in order to help the
                            receiver reconstruct the message. This will require cooperation by both sender and receiver
                            (that is, changes to both gray blocks).</li>
                        <li>Then, solve the problem of packets not arriving at all. That is, make the transmission
                            reliable even though IP is unreliable. This, too, will require changing both sender and
                            receiver. </li>
