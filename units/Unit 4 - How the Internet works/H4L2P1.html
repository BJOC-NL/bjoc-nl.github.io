                always pronounced the same: like "outer."</div>
            <p>The <strong>end to end</strong> architecture of the Internet means that routers only know how to find an
                IP address; they don't do anything with the content of the message. Making sense of content is the job

        </div>
        <p>The Internet isn't just a network of computers. It's a <em>network of networks</em>. The connection points
            between networks are called <strong>routers</strong>, networking devices that route traffic between
            subnetworks on the Internet. The routers only know how to pass information on to the next router or to the
            final destination; the routers do <em>not</em> analyze what's inside each packet of data (as long as you
            live in a country without Internet censorship). Making sense of the information happens at the destination
            computer. This is called the <strong>end to end</strong> principle. </p>

            <p>An <strong>IP address</strong> is a unique number assigned to each device on a computer network. </p>
            <p><strong>Packet switching</strong> means that the Internet sends short bursts of information, not long
                continuous strings. </p>
        </div>

        <h3>How Do Routers Know Where to Find the Computer You Want?</h3>
        <p>Every device on the Internet
            <!--(including smart phones, routers, Internet-enabled appliances, etc.)--> has a unique <strong>Internet
                Protocol (IP) address</strong> (or more than one, if it's a router), like a postal or email address. The
            Internet Protocol specifies how a router handles a request for a different IP address. Each router knows the
            layout of its specific neighborhood of the Internet and knows which way to send each message to get it a
            little bit closer to where it's going. The fact that each router doesn't have to know the complete Internet
            improves scalability. </p>
        <p>Usually, there are many possible paths from one endpoint to another. This redundancy allows IP to find an
            alternate pathway if some system in the middle doesn't respond to requests by finding an alternate pathway.
            This is the principle of fault tolerance. </p>
        <p>When you send a data over the Internet, the IP program in your computer divides it into <em>packets</em> that
            it sends individually. (Each may take a different path.) This process is what makes the Internet a
            <strong>packet switching</strong> network. </p>

                <li>Why does the graph of the Internet look like a tangle in the middle with fireworks on the outsides?
                </li>
                <li>Discuss how this shape is related to how people connect to the Internet (though an Internet Service
                    Provider, etc.). Write out a brief description and/or explain it to someone else. </li>
                <li>Visit <a href="http://bot.whatismyipaddress.com/"
                        target="_blank">http://bot.whatismyipaddress.com/</a> for your current IP address. </li>
                <div class="sidenoteBig">You can add any IP address to the end of that URL like this: <a
                        href="http://ipinfo.io/128.59.105.24" target="_blank">http://ipinfo.io/128.59.105.24</a></div>

            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>The amount of detailed information available from an IP address is pretty amazing (and a little scary),
            especially when you think about the ways that information can be used. </p>
        <div class="sidenote">Some of the information might have slight inaccuracies. IP addresses often give the
            location of an Internet service provider, possibly at a different location. </div>

        <h3>IPv4</h3>
        <img class="imageRight" src="../../bjc-r/img/4-internet/ipv4.png" width="325" alt="Geen Afbeelding" />
        <p>Each of the four numbers in a typical IP address today is an eight-bit <strong>byte</strong> with a value
            between 0 and 255 (see right). A 32-bit IPv4 (the &quot;v&quot; stands for &quot;version&quot;) address is
            big enough to support 2<sup>32</sup> computers. That's about four billion (4 &middot; 10<sup>9</sup>), but
            there are more than <em>seven</em> billion people on Earth, so there aren't enough IP addresses to go
            around. </p>
        <div class="endnote"><strong>Why does IPv4 support 2<sup>32</sup> computers?</strong> There are 32 bits in an
            IPv4 address (see right), and each bit can be one of two possible values (0 or 1). So, there are
            2<sup>32</sup> possibilities with thirty-two bits. </div>


        <h3>IPv6</h3>
        <img class="imageRight" src="../../bjc-r/img/4-internet/ipv6.png" width="325" height="50%"
            alt="Geen Afbeelding" />
        <p>The long-term solution is to increase the length of an IP address. The new IP addresses are 128 bits wide,
            which is enough to support 2<sup>128</sup> (about 10<sup>38</sup>) computers. </p>
        <div class="endnote"><strong>Will this always be enough, or will we need to upgrade the addressing system
                again?</strong> There are an estimated 10<sup>29</sup> stars in the observable universe. So even if the
            Internet is extended to include other planets or space aliens, we'll <em>still</em> have enough addresses
            with IPv6. </div>

                <div class="endnote">Most likely, the router in your home or school uses a protocol that allows all the
                    computers on the local network (such as in one building) to share a single IP address on the
                    Internet, which can be cheaper. The router that creates the local network gives each computer a
                    <em>local address</em>. For example, although the outside world may think someone's computer has IP
                    address 108.26.181.226, that computer itself might think its address is 192.168.1.11. </div>
                <li>Look up your current <em>local</em> IP address in your system preferences or settings. It's usually
                    under network or Internet settings and may be listed with the computer device supporting that
                    connection (wifi, Ethernet, wifi, Bluetooth, etc.). </li>

            <div class="endnote">The 192.168 <em>domain</em> (the block of IP addresses that all start with 192.168) is
                reserved for <em>local</em> networks, but no computer on the Internet has an address in that range.
