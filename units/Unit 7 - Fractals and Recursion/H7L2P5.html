            Mondrian did not use a computer, but we can use recursion to <em>model</em> his paintings and create similar
            images:<br />
            <div class="sidenoteBig">The corners of the outside border in this picture are missing. This happens when
                you

                    alt="Geen Afbeelding"> and use a large pen size, as we did for this
                project.
                You will probably want to change that setting back for other projects.</div>

                    <div class="comment">PG: There's no time to fix this now, but this is <em>so</em> scaffolded that
                        the
                        only work the student is left to do is <em>not</em> about the recursion. The recursion is harder
                        here, but that's what the lesson should be about. Instead, learning about recursion is
                        sidestepped.
                        The student chooses numbers—an exercise in fractions—but never needs even to look at the
                        structure
                        and does no actual programming beyond the base case, a Unit 1 task. In revision, reverse the
                        scaffolding. Also not clear why we have the scripts with hat blocks. This is all stuff the
                        student
                        can do. </div> <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/7-recursion/U7L2-Mondrian.xml"
                        target="_blank"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/load-save.png"
                            alt="Geen Afbeelding"></a><br /> Some
                    blocks
                    are already created for you and the script that calls <code>Mondrian</code> is already set up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    First, finish programming the base case, the <code>rectangle</code> block. Use a line of color with
                    a
                    pen size the width of the rectangle to paint the inside and then create the black border. Maintain
                    state
                    transparency.
                    <div class="endnote">The <code>rectangle</code> block already contains two custom blocks for you to
                        use.
                        Look inside these two custom blocks to see how they work.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click "r" a few times to be sure you have <code>rectangle</code> set up correctly. Each time, you
                    should
                    get a big rectangle with one of the five colors inside and a black border, like this:<br />

                        alt="Geen Afbeelding" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/take-turns-speaking-mini.gif"
                            alt="Geen Afbeelding">
                        Then, program the code for the recursive case. The <code>Mondrian</code> block already contains
                        some
                        structure. Your job is to figure out what inputs it will need based on how the script should
                        work.
                        <ul>
                            <li>You've already seen level 1, a filled-in rectangle. At each level, <code>Mondrian</code>
                                subdivides the space it has into <em>two</em> rectangles (which will further subdivide
                                if
                                more levels are required). For example, in level 2, <code>Mondrian</code> will randomly
                                divide the area specified by its <var>width</var> and <var>height</var> inputs in two
                                pieces, and draw a <code>rectangle</code> in each piece. For level 3,
                                <code>Mondrian</code>
                                uses a level-2 <code>Mondrian</code> to subdivide the two smaller rectangles (for a
                                total of
                                four filled-in rectangles). Level 4 will subdivide again, creating eight rectangles, and
                                so
                                on.</li>
                            <li>The <var>fraction</var> variable will contain a random fraction between 1/5 and 4/5,
                                specifying how to subdivide the area at this level. </li>
                            <li>The algorithm decides whether to subdivide the width or the height. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Click "space" a few times. When you have <code>Mondrian</code> working, it should produce pictures
                    like
                    this:<br />

                    Recursion is not just for <em>commands</em> either. You'll learn about recursive <em>reporters</em>
                    in
                    Unit 8. For example, this block reports the factorial of a number. Can you see how it works?<br />
